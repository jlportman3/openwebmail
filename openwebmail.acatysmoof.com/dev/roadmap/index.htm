    <h3>ROADMAP INTRODUCTION</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>OpenWebMail is continually in development, with bug fixes and features constantly being applied to the codebase. Simultanously, the Development Team is working to mature the system by focusing on global issues. The Roadmap details the over-reaching goals that the Development Team is focusing on, as well as the new features that are currently being worked on.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>CURRENT FOCUS</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>OpenWebMail Development is currently focused on the separation of the templating system, the language system, and the logic code.</p>
      <p>There are several issues driving this focus:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The primary driver is unnecessary bloat. Currently, all of the template files contain message strings. Additional message strings are also contained in the language files that exist for each language. The message strings that occupy the templates create a situation in which each template file must be duplicated for every language. This duplication is currently consuming over 4Mb of the code base, which is almost 50% of the total code of the OpenWebMail system.<br><br></li>
        <li>The secondary driver is the need for a universally supported language file format. The current OpenWebMail language files are Perl hash tables. The message string values in the hash tables are referred to by their hash keys, and replace placeholders in the template files with their values. While this system is functional, OpenWebMail Translators can benefit from a move to the gettext PO format. A move to the gettext PO format will enable OpenWebMail Translators to use the several PO tools that are available. These tools simplify translation by quickly identifying untranslated strings. More importantly, they also provide access to translation databases that contain existing string translations that can be applied to OpenWebMail, reducing the time required to complete translations. Finally, the PO format identifies the exact file and line number where each message string originates, greatly helping the translator understand the context of each translation. As OpenWebMail grows these features will help the translators keep translations current and correct.<br><br></li>
        <li>The final driver is the need for a full featured theme system. The current logic code contains embedded HTML which is separate from the template files. Since the HTML is embedded in the logic, there is no way to have multiple template layouts without modifying the logic code.This prevents OpenWebMail from being truly themable without very significant effort and code duplication. As a result, the OpenWebMail interface feels plain and boring, and is only available in one layout style. The current template file format is proprietary and does not have all the features required to support a fully themable interface, such as looping and boolean logic. The current template files use plain strings as placeholders, such as @@@STRING@@@. The templates should be moved to the mature HTML::Template system (afterwards abbreviated as H:T), which supports loops and booleans and is written in pure-perl. H:T can be included with OpenWebMail for sites that do not have the ability to install perl modules and is a common format that is proven across many popular and complex perl projects. OpenWebMail can benefit from H:T without creating any dependancies. For sites that can install perl modules, a significant speedup can be achieved through the template caching features of H:T. Further speedups are possible by installing the XS versions of H:T. Ideally, there should be one template file for each screen presented in the system.<br><br></li>
      </ul>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>CURRENT FOCUS REQUIRED STEPS</h3>
    <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Before the language strings can be considered, the template files first need to be converted to H:T format. During the conversion to H:T, the logic code HTML should be extracted and integrated into the template files. The current layout should not be changed and no new features should be added. Please do not change the layouts to CSS based layouts. Code will be tested in many browsers on many systems. Language strings should be entered into the template files as placeholders until the conversion to H:T is complete and the language strings can be extracted to PO format files. This is a major undertaking that will probably take a few months to complete.<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>Developers need to volunteer to convert templates. Please volunteer for templates from the same OWM system group. The following systems and their screens need to be converted:<br><br>
            <ul>

          </li>
        </ul><br><br>
      </li>
      <li>Language strings in the template files need to be converted into gettext syntax so that they can be extracted automatically. All language strings should be converted to a simple syntax such as:<br>
        <pre>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;gettext("My Project Title")&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre><br>
        more details on this as we get to it.

    <h3>FUTURE FOCUS</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <p>The complete separation of logic, presentation, and language paves the way for the OpenWebMail logic code to be optimized as an Object Oriented system. Object Oriented code will attract more mature and professional developers, as well as increase mantainability. It will also allow features to be more quickly added to the core system. It is important the move to OO does not introduce more dependencies to the core system. This section will be expanded as the Current Focus nears completion.</p>
