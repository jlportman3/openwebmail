Announced:      2005-05-02
Credits:	Matej Vela
                <vela.AT.debian.org>
Affects:        all versions before 20050430
Corrected:      openwebmail versions after 2.51 20050430


I.   Background

     The open(F, $filename) statement in perl will treat some characters in
     $filename as shell escape sequence, which causes the sub string in
     $filename being executed as external command

II.  Problem Description

     Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in OWM due to missing
     validation of CGI parameters supplied as filename

III. Impact

     When correctly exploited, a loginned user can execute arbitrary command
     on the server with privilege of his own uid

IV.  Workaround

     No.

V.   Solution

     upgrade to the latest openwebmail-current.tar.gz
