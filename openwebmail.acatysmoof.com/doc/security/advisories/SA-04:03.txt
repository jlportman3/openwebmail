Topic:          remote user can execute any program with apache

Announced:      2004-05-08
Credits:	Michel Blomgren <michel.AT.cycom.se>

Affects:        all versions between 20031008 and 20040508
Corrected:      openwebmail versions after 2.30 20040508

Patches:        http://openwebmail.acatysmoof.com/download/cert/patches/SA-04:03

I.   Background

     userstat.pl is a script designed for static web pages to query the user mail
     and calendar status in Open WebMail.

II.  Problem Description

     userstat.pl accepted parameter as the userid without strict checking. It
     could be exploited to invoke any program on the server with apache privilege.
     This problem was addressed by the patch from Ken Girrard
     <kgirrard.AT.users.sourceforge.net> at SA-04:01.txt.

     Girrard's patch does filter out spaces and tabs, which makes it impossible
     to pass arguments to commands an attacker would want to execute.
     Nevertheless, the patch doesn't filter out "|" (pipes) and "/", so it's
     still possible to execute commands without arguments.

     This is a very serious vulnerability and should be taken seriously.

III. Impact

     Remote user can execute any program on the openwebmail server with apache.

IV.  Workaround

     The userstat.pl is not used by the Open WebMail runtime system,
     the sysadm can simply remove it.

V.   Solution

     A. upgrade to the latest openwebmail-current.tar.gz

     B. or apply the patch in
