Q: Attachments disappeared when I forward a message?
A: check the permission of the following directories
   cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc          - owner=root, group=mail, mode=750
   cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/sessions - owner=root, group=mail, mode=770
   cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/users    - owner=root, group=mail, mode=770

Q: The permission of cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc is correct but attachments 
   still disappeared in message forwarding?
A: mmm, please upgrade the latest version. 
   Some old version(1.03,1.04) has little problem in attachment handling.

Q: I have problems in reading some mail....
A: please check http://turtle.ee.ncku.edu.tw/openwebmail/download/update.txt
   to see if any update fixes your problem and download the openwebmail-current.tgz

Q: The OpenWebMail is very slow on my system.
A: It depends on how you define the "slow". 

   The response time of OpenWebmail in normal operation would be:
   6 second on a p133 machine.
   3 second on a p200mmx machine.
   1 second on a celeron300 machine.

ps: Some operations would take more time than normal operation, for example:
    indexing on a large folder, adding large attachment to a message.

   It is recommended that you install Open WebMail on a medium-sized machine.
   (ex: Celeron 300 with 128MB ram). Actually it runs well on a pentium 200mmx 
   machine only if you have enough ram installed.

   There is an analysis of memory usage of Open WebMail available at
   http://turtle.ee.ncku.edu.tw/openwebmail/download/memory.usage

Q: How can I report problem?
A: The best way is to send me the message that causes problems.
   a. create a test folder
   b. move the message to the 'test' folder
   c. save the 'test' folder to a zip file
   ps: in version 1.06 or above, you can save a folder into a zip file
       by clicking the foldername in "folder management" menu
   d. mail it to me as an attachment and describe what the problem is.

Q: Can I use Open WebMail in a commerical web site? 
   Can I change the page layout of openwebmail?
A: Open WebMail is GPL software (please see copyright.txt for detail of GPL).
   You can use or distribute it freely and you can also change the layout 
   of Open WebMail only if
   a. Any improvement of Open WebMail or any product based on Open WebMail 
      must be released to the public, and
   b. The link 'Open WebMail' must be kept on the web page to enable the user
      link back to the home of Open WebMail.

ps: I would be happy if you mail me a message that your commerical website
    is using Open WebMail. I may put it into the webpage as some kind of 
    advertisments :)
