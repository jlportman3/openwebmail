Q: I got "Internal server error" when running openwebmail?
A: please check you have install a complete set of perl 5.005 above

Q: I got "can not do setuid" error?
A: You may uncompress the openwebmail-1.xx.tgz with improper parameter.
   It is "tar -zxvBpf openwebmail-.1.xx.tgz"

Q: I still got "cannot do set uid" error?
A: You perl is compiled with suid ability disabled.
   a. check if you have a executable of suidperl 
      'chmod 4755 suidperl'
      and change #!/usr/bin/perl to the path of this suidperl
   b. recompile your perl with suid enabled

Q: Attachments disappeared when I forward a message?
A: check the permission of the following directories
   cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc          - owner=root, group=mail, mode=750
   cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/sessions - owner=root, group=mail, mode=770
   cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/users    - owner=root, group=mail, mode=770

Q: The permission cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc is correct but attachments 
   still disappeared in message forwarding?
A: mmm, please upgrade the latest version. 
   Some old version(1.03,1.04) has little problem in attachment handling.

Q: I have problems in reading some mail....
A: please check http://turtle.ee.ncku.edu.tw/openwebmail/download/update.txt
   to see if any update fixes your problem and download the openwebmail-current.tgz

Q: The OpenWebMail is very slow on my system.
A: It depends on how you define the "slow". 

   The response time of OpenWebmail in normal operation would be:
   6 second on a p133 machine.
   3 second on a p200mmx machine.
   1 second on a celeron300 machine.

ps: Some operations would take more time than normal operation like:
    re-indexing of a large folder, adding large attachment to a message.

   It is recommended that you install Open WebMail on a medium-sized machine.
   (ex: Celeron 300 with 128MB ram). Actually it runs well on a pentium 200mmx 
   machine only if you have enough ram installed.

   There is an analysis of memory usage of Open WebMail available at
   http://turtle.ee.ncku.edu.tw/openwebmail/download/memory.usage

Q: How can I report problem?
A: The best way is send me the message that has problems.
   a. create a test folder
   b. move the message to the 'test' folder
   c. save the 'test' folder to a zip file
   ps: in version 1.06 or above, you can save a folder into a zip file
       by clicking the foldername in "folder management" menu
   d. mail it to me as an attachment and describe what the problem is.
