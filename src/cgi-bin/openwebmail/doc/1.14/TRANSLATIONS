How to submit a NeoMail translation
===================================

1. Make a copy of the file named "en" under the "lang" subdirectory in the name
of the 2-letter abbreviation for your chosen language.

2. Replace each value in the hashes defined there (between the single quotes)
with a translation for your language, as verbatim as is possible.

3. Translate the text of each .template file that's in the templates directory,
taking care to maintain the formatting exactly the same as is currently in the
file.  This should be done using a text editor, not some GUI HTML editor, which
may lose critical pieces of the templates.

4. Test your additions by adding the language abbreviation and name to the
appropriate section of your neomail.conf, and copying your 2-letter-abbreviated
translation file to the /var/neomail/lang directory, while copying your
templates to /var/neomail/templates/[2-letter-abbrev], such as
/var/neomail/templates/en for English.

If all looks well, Send the resulting files to me, I'll plug them in, and the
next version of NeoMail will support your language!  That's the plan, anyway. ;)

Thanks!
