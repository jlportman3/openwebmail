Changes from version 1.13, rerelease:
   * Changed login() to avoid printing UNKNOWNUSER messages to neomail.log,
     setting the $user variable earlier instead,  to eliminate some user
     confusion.  People thought that the messages indicated an error.
   * Made sure something clickable exists for messages with a subject: header
     but nothing in it when headers are displayed... messages will now show a
     sibject line of "N/A."
   * Specified an action tag on all startform() calls, as newer versions of
     CGI.pm apparently were adding an action tag consisting of the script and
     all parameters in plaintext, even though unnecessary for scripts that call
     themselves.  The versions of CGI.pm that ship with most Linux distros
     don't have this feature, regardless of what the docs say... Musta been a
     bug.   Anyway, this wasn't really a security issue, even on the first page
     with userid and password being shown, since NeoMail pages are marked non-
     cacheable anyway... still, it was disconcerting for some users to see that,
     and understandably so.  Thanks to Thomas Hartwig for bringing the oddity
     to my attention.
   * Included updated icons supplied by Ian Cumming.
   * Modified viewfolder.template (all languages) to better align menubar.
   * New message lines are now shown in bold in folder listings.
   * Security enhancement: No longer worry about symlinks when reading in files
     from home directories, just change UID/GID to appropriate IDs so that files
     inaccessible by the user logged in are inaccessible by NeoMail.
   * Links in the body of messages now open in a new window.

Changes from version 1.13, original release:
   * Made a quick re-release of 1.13 to fix a problem some people were
     experiencing with cookies... Apparently different individuals got
     different variations of the problem, all causing the same result:
     neomail-prefs.pl couldn't see neomail.pl's cookie.  Now, according to the
     CGI.pm docs, the cookie path should be set to '/' which would work, but
     Mark Thomas informed me that it was being set to /cgi-bin/ which, again,
     should work (and was in fact the case for me) but doesn't in some
     instances of rewritten URLs and the like.  OTOH, thhart from the
     SourceForge bugtracker says his install is setting the cookie path to
     the entire path of the neomail.pl and causting the problem.  In any case,
     the version posted now has the path explicitly set to what the docs say are
     the default to avoid this issue altogether.  I'd increment the version
     number for this minor change but it's easier to re-release and have people
     with the problem re-download.  Thanks to both of the guys mentioned above
     for their great bug reports, with detailed troubleshooting info.  I had
     gotten a couple reports without such detailed info and since I hadn't
     heard much from most people assumed it was user error.  Thanks guys!

Changes from version 1.12:
   * Added JavaScript to the login page to automatically focus the userid
     field.  Thanks for the suggestion Ryk.
   * Changed session validation method from IP to cookie, to bypass issues with
     multi-homing proxies and the like altogether.

Changes from version 1.11:
   * Fixed a problem where NeoMail wouldn't always display the contents of the
     attachments where the first attachment was plaintext.  Thanks to Elmo Recio
     for the sample spool.
   * Fixed an issue where NeoMail wouldn't open a message if it had a really
     long message-id that was on a line of its own after the message-id: header.
     Thanks to Travis Fitch for the sample mail spool exhibiting the problem.
   * Added Finnish translation, provided by Mikael Puusa.

Changes from version 1.10:
   * Security fix -- I won't divulge here, anyone who checks the diffs can
     surely figure it out... suffice it to say, I remembered why I REALLY hated
     the idea of storing stuff in a user's home directory.
   * Fix in setup.pl - Home directory Mailbox file setups weren't being
     installed setuid.

Changes from version 1.05:
   * Getheaders() had broken line-continuation handling since the performance
     update some time ago.  Thanks to Rainer Perske for catching this
     long-standing bug, along with a couple of smaller ones.
   * Support for folder storage in ~user/mail was added.  When enabled, NeoMail
     enters PINE compatibility mode, in which it creates folders readable by
     PINE, and uses the PINE mbox files for sent-mail and saved-messages.  Note
     that you MUST make sure all NeoMail users have ~/mail directories in this
     case.  I recommend setting it up in your skel directory, and creating one
     for already existing users.  This option will install NeoMail suid root.
     If you appreciate this feature, send your thanks to Joe Klemmer,
     klemmerj@webtrek.com, as this feature is in because he hired me on contract
     to add it, and insisted it be included in the public distribution.  Nice
     guy, that Joe fellow, eh? :)
   * setup.pl has been streamlined, to better detect the full path of Apache's
     DocumentRoot and ScriptAlias, allowing for a fully automatic install, no
     longer requiring manual copying of the CGI scripts or image files.  It will
     set neomail*.pl suid root when necessary based on your answers to the
     questions it asks, and will make sure that if this is the case,
     checklogin.pl is NOT suid root, to avoid the nasty warning message that'll
     show up in web logs otherwise.

Changes from version 1.04:
   * Bug in the Dutch composemessage.template that caused selections for
     addresses for the To: field to end up in the BCC: field instead.
   * Added Danish translation from Søren Ulrik.

Changes from version 1.03:
   * Removed the useless checklogin() sub... Completely forgot and left it in
     when it became unnecessary.
   * Security enhancement: Changed the way in which checklogin.pl is called, to
     avoid usernames/passwords being visible if a user manages to fire off a ps
     while a login is being checked.

Changes from version 1.02:
   * Fixed "compose message" link being broken when in a folder with a space in
     its name.
   * Added https:// to the list of link types to be auto-activated.

Changes from version 1.01:
   * Fixed from name not saving in user prefs page. Thanks to Ferry Korving for
     the heads-up.
   * Security enhancement:  An existing session can only be accesses from the IP
     that initiated the session, nowhere else.
   * Changed message body in composition window to be 72 chars wide instead of
     76 -- same for the signature textarea in the prefs screen.  Hopefully will
     solve issues with sendmail starting new lines in places that make the
     message's formatting different that it appears on the compose screen.
   * Minor security enhancement: setup.pl uses chown -Rh instead of just chown
     -R.
   * Fixed an issue with the wrong first message being displayed in the folder
     when refreshing at the last page, along with the wrong page number showing
     up.

Changes from version 1.00:
   * Fixed yet another Outlook oddity.  Some text attachments had no actual
     header information and weren't being detected properly. Thanks Scott!
   * Fixed detection of From: addresses with <> around the address but no
     real name info.
   * Fixed an account with the password the same as the username and password
     field left blank on login allowing access without password.  Minor security
     fix, since if you're allowing people to have passwords the same as their
     usernames, you're in serious trouble anyway. :)

Changes from version 1.0pre1:
   * The NeoMail logo has been replaced with one designed by Erik Rudolfs.
     Thanks, Erik!
   * Added user documentation suitable for linking from the login page,
     by Chris Fisher.  Thanks, Chris!
   * Some MTAs/MUAs don't label Content-Types as text/plain, but just text.
     Stopped requiring the types to contain "text/", now it's just "text".
     Thanks to Andrew Schretter for the example message.
   * Added a preference for the user's From: address.  The patch was submitted
     by Eric Andreychek, who finally convinced me this might be a good thing.
     Some slight changes were made to the code to accomodate a new variable
     being introduced into the sendmail invocations, to keep users from
     confusing themselves by adding a space somewhere in their from: address.
     Please note that the default will be the correct from: address they should
     use based on their username.
   * Rewrote the hyperlink generator regexp to allow more URLs to be correctly
     detected and not terminate early.
   * Modified setup.pl to do a chown/chmod on the neomaildir as well as its
     subdirectories.
   * Added a Polish translation from Marek Babik.

Changes from version 0.99b:
   * Some strange e-mail addresses would cause problems when opening up the
     during-compose address book.  Fixed.
   * Setup.pl was separating user/group with a period in recursive chowns, and
     some UNIX variants didn't like periods.  Switched it to colons instead.

Changes from version 0.99a:
   * Add button in compose form wasn't being skipped on tab press.  Fixed.
   * If improperly installed (without checklogin.pl in the right place) neomail
     would allow any user to authenticate regardless of password.  Again, I
     stress, this would only occur if neomail was improperly installed.  Fixed
     in this version.  Thanks to Pit Shing for being the first to report this.
   * Some MUAs apparently send the bodies of messages encoded via base64.
     NeoMail now handles this properly.
   * Fixed a bug where when retrieving a message that had a second message-id
     field somewhere in the message body, the message wouldn't be returned.
   * Added Portuguese translation, courtesy of Marcos Dutra.
   * Updated Russian lang file from Dmitry.

Changes from version 0.99:
   * Made attachment listing appear in italics instead of bold.
   * NeoMail now no longer needs to run suid root.  It runs sgid mail by default
     and calls a suid root script called "checklogin.pl" to verify logins.  If
     you store your passwords in a file that doesn't need root privs to read it,
     you can safely remove the setuid bit there.  I suspect this is going to get
     me plenty of false bug reports, as it's a confusing setup for novices, but
     immeasurably more secure.

Changes from version 0.98b:
   * Updated Dutch translation with changes submitted from Walter Van Driel.
   * Fixed a problem creating hyperlinks out of message URLs with + in them.
   * Decode foreign characters in attachment filenames.
   * Grab default Real Name entry from the password file if one exists, rather
     than always default to "Your Name" for first time users.  "Your Name" is
     still a fallback if no entry exists or no GECOS info is gotten.
   * Multiple attachment support is in.  Thank Håvard Skrødahl for putting
     enough *friendly* pressure on me for this one to get added, and the next
     one...
   * Forwarded messages now include attachments by default.  If the attachments
     exceed the attachment size limit, no additional files will be allowed to
     be added, but the ones in the message already will forward OK.
   * Probably some more stuff I'm forgetting. :)
   * This release incorporates a few major changes, contrary to what I've been
     wanting to do ever since .95, but these are the last of them, aside from
     bugfixes and slight touch-ups, I swear.  Anyone requesting a brand-new
     feature before NeoMail hits 1.0 at this point will be taken out and shot.
     ;)  I fully expect we'll find bugs in the new code, so if you're nervous
     about it, hang back for a few minor revs until the kinks get worked out
     unless you really need the new features.

Changes from version 0.98a:
   * Reduced memory usage of getmessage().
   * Optimized updatestatus() and movemessage() to grab the mail spool without
     looping over the entire thing line by line.
   * Added Slovak translation from Maros Michalik.
   * Added Italian translation from Mauro Allegrini.
   * Handle messages that have no body, only an attachment, as sent by MS
     Outlook when no body is typed.  Thanks to Håvard Skrødahl for reminding me
     about this longstanding issue.
   * NeoMail now correctly loads the user's selected language on first folder
     display after login.

Changes from version 0.98:
   * Folder name displayed when hovering over the "Back to" icon is displayed
     in the appropriate language, as are the address book fields in the pop-up
     address book when sending messages.
   * Number of messages to display at one time pref wasn't getting used until
     the screen just after the initial login.  Fixed.
   * Added French translation, provided by Camille Constans.
   * Added Spanish translation, courtesy of Pedro Del Medico.

Changes from version 0.97b:
   * Added support for limits on outgoing attachment size.  This can be a real
     lifesaver, if you have users constantly attaching huge files they can put a
     huge load on the server.  Translators, please see your file in the /lang/
     directory and translate the English messages if you get a chance. :)
   * Updated Dutch template files from Albert Pauw.
   * Added Russian translation from Dmitry Kuzmenko.
   * Modified composemessage templates to cause IE to tab through to the correct
     fields when composing messages.  Thanks, Dana Basken!
   * Fixed a bug where NeoMail wouldn't decode quoted-printable text portions
     of the message where the message type is multipart and the first attachment
     contains the real message body.  Thanks to Håvard Skrødahl again for the
     bug report. :)
   * Included a more intuitive logout icon courtesy of Scott McCrory.
   * message bodies in a multipart MIME-encoded message have the necessary HTML
     tags added now to display spacing and tabs properly.

Changes from version 0.97a:
   * Fixed handling of attachments with apostrophes in their names.
   * Added SEVERAL new translations:
      - Norwegian, courtesy of my new friend Håvard Skrødahl.
      - Dutch, courtesy of Albert Pauw.
      - Romanian, courtesy of Cristian D. GAL.
      - Hungarian, courtesy of Roodie.
      If you submitted a translation and didn't include the spelling of your
      language in your native tongue (ex. German == Deutsch), please get back to
      me with that info. :)
   * Fixed not MIME decoding the last message in the spool.  Thanks for the
     sample spool, Woody Suwalski. :)

Changes from version 0.97:
   * Quota support is in.  What it does is place a limit on space used up by a
     user's non-INBOX folders (INBOX still would have to be handled by sendmail/
     filesystem quotas) that, once exceeded, prevents them from saving any
     further messages.  All messages sent to TRASH are deleted immediately, all
     other attempts to move messages are greeted with error text explaining the
     situation.  This isn't a *hard* quota in that sense.  The operation that
     sends them over the limit will still succeed, but their folder
     functionality will be severely limited until they free up that space.

Changes from version 0.96:
   * Internationalization is in... New translations are welcome.  See the
     TRANSLATIONS file for info on how to put one together.
   * German translation added.  Many kudos to EXP for the first translation
     submission! :)
   * In the interest of further supporting internationalization, NeoMail
     properly decodes MIME-encoded characters in message headers.
   * Fixed the Outlook fixes, so they work on Perl 5.004 again. :)

Changes from version 0.95:
   * Switched to small images in the menu bar, to hopefully make navigation
     more intuitive for those who like that.  Hover over the images and the
     text labels will still show up as they're in the ALT tags.
   * Fixed an issue with certain versions of Outlook placing attachments on a
     message that NeoMail didn't see as attachments, and thus tacked to the end
     of the message, in plain text.  Outlook still does all sorts of stuff
     that makes NeoMail's life difficult, but this makes one less. :) Thanks
     to Håvard Skrødahl for the example messages.
   * Fixed ADDITIONAL Outlook issues with message boundaries/attachment names.
     This should just about cover all the Outlook peculiarities.  Thanks to
     [iNC] for the example message on this one.
   * Fixed a problem where the "From " line would show up twice when All Headers
     was selected when reading a message.

Changes from version 0.82:
   * Added user-created folder support, ability to move messages from the
     inbox to a folder of your choice, and an "Empty Trash" function that
     empties the entire trash in one step, making the lives of people who
     let their trash accumulate a lot easier.
   * NeoMail now reads its preferences from a central neomail.conf in the
     /var/neomail directory.
   * $hashedmailspools configuration option added, to allow admins to use
     NeoMail with hashed mail spools like /var/spool/mail/u/s/username.
   * Added a user-configurable option for how many messages you'd like to
     display at one time on a folder view.
   * NeoMail now supports multiple from: domains in one script, to better equip
     admins to allow multiple domains to be used in one install of NeoMail.
     Users can select the domain they'd like to use from the preferences page.
     ***Bear in mind that this means EXISTING users will have no domain appended
     to their e-mail addresses until they visit the prefs page and save their
     choice of domain!
   * Fixed a problem with attachment boundaries being handled improperly in
     rare cases.
   * A new style, Violet, was added.
   * Fixed a bug where status updates only occured if the mail was in the INBOX.
   * Avoid writing to neomail.log if it's a symlink.  Yes, the system would
     have to be compromised already and a symlink placed in a chmod 700 root-
     owned directory for this to become a problem, but still, better safe than
     sorry. :)
   * Disallow any and all root logins, to prevent brute force password cracks.

Changes from version 0.81:
   * A small change to neomailerror() to make NeoMail a bit more resilient
     upon an improper install.  If you didn't have problems after your
     initial install, there's no need to upgrade.

Changes from version 0.80:
   * Fixed a nasty bug that would have allowed an arbitrary
     file to be deleted from $neomaildir given the properly constructed URL.
     Thanks a LOT for the heads up, Matt Carothers!
   * Fixed a bug that caused empty signatures to be replaced by the default
     signature when the prefs page is visited.  Thanks for the report, Rick!

Changes from version 0.71:
   * Added feedback.pl, a question-asking program that admins can run to send
     some thoughts back to me regarding their experiences with NeoMail via
     e-mail.
   * Added template support.  Almost all NeoMail pages are now generated by
     loading up template files and placing key information in the locations
     specified by special text triggers.  Read TEMPLATES for more information
     on creating your own custom looks.  I'd be interested in seeing the results
     of your work!
   * Included several new styles to select from, courtesy of Daans.
   * NeoMail now uses URL-escaped Message-IDs, which seems to have eliminated
     the issues I was running into where some MUAs were generating funky IDs and
     confusing NeoMail.
   * Remaining space in the Address Book is now calculated properly for imports.
   * Inline image attachment display is in.  If an attachment is a .jpg, .gif,
     or .png, NeoMail now decodes it, and displays the image inline with the
     text of the message.
   * Attachment downloads are now accomplished via a hyperlink, instead of a
     button, allowing the user to compensate for some browsers that oddly
     resist downloading attachments properly.  Just use the browser's "Save
     as..." feature.
   * Probably more small changes and bugfixes, this release is long overdue.
     My apologies for the wait, but my real job has kept me busy lately.

Changes from version 0.70:
   * Fixed a long-standing HTML problem with folder displays, causing
     problems with the display on several web browsers, including IE for the
     Macintosh.  While I was at it, I also cleaned up the HTML of Olivier
     M's layout as well as fixing the HTML errors.

Changes from version 0.65:
   * Totally reworked getheaders() and getmessage() to be much less RAM-hungry.
     Time to display a 20MB mail folder dropped from 30 seconds to 12 seconds
     on one test machine.  Still need to optimize updatestatus(), savemessage()
     and deletemessage(), though. They're going to be a bit trickier.
   * Display number of unread messages in a folder now.
   * Fixed a problem with mail messages that were timestamped with a GMT offset
     in letter form (EST) instead of numeric form (-0500).  Conversions are now
     done on the fly so sorting works properly and no more warning messages are
     sent to the error log.  Thanks to Elliott Atkins <elliott@ook.co.uk> for
     the heads-up!
   * When sending attachments with an unknown mime type, no longer default to
     text/plain, but instead, application/octet-stream, to avoid any MUA
     attempts to display inline instead of as a downloadable attachment.

Changes from version 0.60:
   * Totally redesigned the UI based on a layout done by Olivier M.  It's more
     text-centric now.
   * Since the large buttons were removed, went ahead and changed the /buttons/
     dir to /images/ instead.
   * Implemented support for user preferences.
   * Implemented support for address books.
   * Implemented support for "styles." I'd call them themes, but I don't know
     that they are really in-depth enough to call that.  3 are included, and
     I'm encouraging users to create their own pleasing styles and send them
     in!  The "Default" style needs to be in $neomaildir/styles for NeoMail to
     function properly.
   * Fixed handling of whitespace in headers and message bodies.
   * Fixed "From:" address not showing the selected Real Name when sending
     mail.
   * Made some changes to the way that NeoMail handles replies and forwards to
     be more bandwidth-friendly.
   * Added folder support.  INBOX, SENT, TRASH, and SAVED folders currently exist.
     At this point, I'm debating as to whether user-creatable folders are really all
     that necessary.  They'll probably go in soon enough, though.
   * Maildir support is out in this release, pending someone updating the maildir
     support that existed in 0.60 to support all the latest features.  I would HIGHLY
     appreciate anyone who wants to take a look at the neomail-maildir-devel source
     tree and make a stab at cleaning it up and readying a version for release doing
     so, as my time is limited, and I wanted to get a non-pre release out the door
     so people would try it out and hopefully submit some styles and/or feedback.
   * Probably lots more I'm forgetting. :)

Changes from version 0.56:
   * Split neomail into two scripts, one for Sendmail and other MTAs that
     store mail spools in standard mbox-style mail spools, including qmail
     except when in Maildir mode, and a separate version that handles Maildir
     support exclusively.  This removed a lot of bloat that was beginning to
     creep in with a huge number of if/thens all over the place to handle
     whether Maildir support was enabled, and enabled further optimizations
     to take place for each respective spool format without harming the other.
     All releases will still have equivalent feature sets whether using
     the Maildir version of NeoMail or the standard one.
   * Maildir neomail now supports vmailmgr (passwd file) authentication.
   * Setup scripts for each version included, and referenced by the main
     setup.pl script.
   * Sort by message size added, and all sorts have the ability to be
     displayed in ascending or descending order, by toggling between them, with
     an arrow display indicating current sort order.
   * Messages with attachments will show a paper clip icon in the status column
     of header display.
   * New mails will display a closed envelope icon in the status column.  This
     feature is implemented using the Status: header used by most MUAs in the
     mbox version of NeoMail, so messages read by other programs will be
     reflected in NeoMail and vice-versa.
   * A next message/previous message button has been added to the Read Message
     screen. On deleted messages, NeoMail will display the next message if
     there is one, the previous message if not, or if there are no more
     messages, it will go back to the Inbox, much to the delight of the many
     people that requested this feature. :)
   * Message numbers are now displayed both in the read message screen and in
     the main message listing.
   * From: addresses are now listed by name if available, and are hyperlinks
     to a send mail form that already has the To: address filled out.
   * changed logout() to simply redirect the user to the login page afterwards
     instead of printing it again.
   * Replies are now printed with preceding ">"s before each line.
   * When large numbers were entered into the Jump field, NeoMail would take
     a long time bringing the next page up.... Fixed.  Thanks to Gary Harris
     <gary@konnekted.com> for the heads up!
   * Certain Message-IDs containing characters significant to CGI parameters weren't
     being properly found when trying to read... Fixed.  Thanks to Gary again for the
     problem report.
   * www.anything.com or whatever other simple URLs in a message now, without the
     http:// in the beginning, will be links as well. This does not include if they are
     followed by slashes.

Changes from version 0.55B:
   * Added two much-requested features.
     - Multi-message deletion support.
     - Sort by date (descending), sender (ascending), and subject (ascending).
   * Reworked table layout to accomodate the delete markers, changed subjects
     to hyperlinks in the process
   * Once logged in, the link to my e-mail address on the bottom of each
     page brings up a neomail send window instead of your default mail client.
   * Minor code cleanups (logging is easier now) because I found out some
     people are actually looking at the code.  I cleaned up some sloppy
     places here and there. :)
   * If anything that wasn't broken before is broken now, TELL ME! There were
     some changes that, while I think they should work, I didn't have a
     testbed for. Qmail Maildir deletions in particular.

Changes from version 0.55:
   * Javascript confirmation dialog upon message delete. Suggested by
     several individuals.
   * Apparently some people were having trouble with their proxy server
     caching NeoMail's output.  Added pragma no-cache to the header to
     avoid this.  Thanks to Michel Zenhäusern for the heads-up.
   * Added a "cancel" button to take a user back to the previous page if
     they decide not to send a composed message.  Another suggestion from
     Michael.
   * Duplicate message header navigation bar at the bottom of header list
     to facilitate easier navigation without needlessly scrolling to the top
     of the message list again.
   * Attachment decoding fix, for when attachment boundaries don't have quotes
     around them... Thanks again Olivier, for catching that one.
   * changes in setup.pl to make it a little smarter about hostname and web
     server uid/gid detection.
   * More...
   * Also, if you submitted a suggestion and it didn't get implemented, my
     apologies.  Rest assured that I do read and consider implementing all
     suggestions I recieve, but my priority list may differ from any given
     user's, and there are ideas that won't get implemented, no matter how
     good they sound, because of the difficulty in integrating them with the
     current codebase. Judging by all the positive feedback I've been getting,
     I'm guessing users are pretty happy with what's there so far, at least.
     :)

Changes from version 0.54:
   * MAILDIR SUPPORT!  Many of you asked for it, but thanks to Olivier
     Mueller <omueller@8304.ch> for sending the documentation I needed and
     a sample Maildir tree my way to help me make this happen. Please let
     me know how this works for you, as it's brand new code.
   * Admins can now configure the number of messages to display at a time,
     and NeoMail will provide last/next buttons, as well as a jump field to
     navigate your mail spool with.  If you want the old behavior, just
     specify an obscenely large number here. :) Thanks to Justin
     <justin@aspect.net> for nagging me about that today. ;)
   * NeoMail now sorts messages from newest/oldest, and displays the date
     in a shorter form on the headers page.  At this point I'm not
     considering adding other "sort by" options, but feel free to nag
     me about it, maybe it'll change my mind. (Nah... :) ) Thanks again
     Justin.
   * Set wrap to "hard" on sending page, so word wrap will actually send
     carriage returns, and changed the textarea size to 72 columns.
   * NeoMail now embeds an X-IPAddress header in sent mails to help track
     down spammers.  Thanks for the idea, R P Herrold <herrold@owlriver.com>.
   * I keep feeling I'm forgetting some things, so let's just say "more..."
     here. :)

Changes from version 0.53B:
   * Setup.pl now checks to make sure that suidperl is installed and has the
     correct permissions.  If not, it will prompt the user for action.
   * We now hide the "DON'T DELETE THIS MESSAGE' message generated by IMAP.
     At least we should be now... My contact on that one hasn't gotten back
     to me!
   * A toggle button has been added when viewing messages to display the full
     headers of the message.  Thanks to Walter van Driel again for the
     suggestion. :)
   * NeoMail can now log all sorts of handy info to a file you specify during
     configuration either manually or using setup.pl.  Another Walter
     suggestion implemented. ;)
   * Changed the default neomail directory to /var/neomail from /var/webmail.
     This was a leftover from back when I didn't think I'd actually get a
     working mail client and I was just playing around for my own education.
     :)
   * Removed the "expires" HTTP header in printheader(). It was giving the
     Linux version of Netscape very strange behavior.

Changes from version 0.53:
   * Changed hyperlinks to relative. Still rooted at /, but they don't have the
     http:// anymore, to facilitate calling them via either http:// or
     https://... Thanks to Walter van Driel <wvdriel@inetxs.nl> for the tip.

Changes from version 0.52:
   * Fixed a bug preventing replies from always having the correct information
     in the To: field.
   * Added setup.pl, which takes care of most of the grunt work of configuring
     and installing NeoMail, including setting the PROPER PERMISSIONS on
     /var/neomail and neomail.pl.

Changes from version 0.51B:
   * Removed the huge NeoMail version info at the top of each page, moved it to
     the fine print at the bottom, along with a link to the NeoMail homepage.
   * Moved around a misplaced comment or two in the script.
   * Fixed a lot of annoying little warning cluttering up web logs if there was
     no CC entry, or Subject line, etc. in an incoming message.
   * Fixed a bug where a plaintext, quoted-printable encoded attachment
     wouldn't getdecoded if it was the first attachment, and displayed inline.

Changes from version 0.51:
   * Back to my custom password verification code... Looks like I was wrong
     about that "should have to begin with" junk.  getpwnam doesn't necessarily
     grab passwords from /etc/shadow correctly in all cases.  Specifying the
     password file is much more reliable and also allows you to create custom
     password verification files that differ from regular passwords for other
     system access.... Another security plus.

Changes from version 0.50:
   * Use getpwnam to retrieve encrypted passwords, as I should have to begin
     with!
