NeoMail FAQ
======================

Q. NeoMail seems to be running properly, but I can't see my INBOX!  It's always
   empty even though I know I have mail.

A. Most commonly, this results from installing NeoMail sgid mail, but having a
   mail server that doesn't actually store user mail spools with group
   read/write bits turned on.  See the instructions at the end of the INSTALL
   file regarding running setuid root instead, or, better yet, set up your
   mail spools to be read/writable by a common group.  The other possibility is
   that you've not specified the correct location for your spoolfiles
   altogether.

Q. NeoMail is installed, but I get a message about it not being able to find
   neomail.conf in any of the @INC directories!

A. This is usually a permissions thing, make sure that neomail.pl and
   neomail-prefs.pl have the proper permissions to read the /var/neomail
   directory.

Q. NeoMail keeps bombing out, saying something about not being able to open the
   Default style!

A. This often seems to be due to Slackware Linux not having a working suidperl.
   Most users have reported success after recompiling perl from scratch, making
   sure to say "no" when asked if their kernel is suid-script secure, and "yes"
   when asked if they want to use suid script emulation during the Configure
   script.  If you're not running Slackware, other causes could be among those
   listed below w/ regards to login issues.

Q. I got NeoMail installed OK, but I can't login! No matter what I type I
   get the invalid password message.  Also, my Apache error_log shows reads on
   a closed filehandle, <PASSWD> and a couple uses of undefined values as well.
   What gives?

A. This means that, for some reason, NeoMail is having trouble opening the file
   you specified as your encrypted password file during setup.pl, or in the
   $passwdfile variable if you configured NeoMail manually.

   The root of this problem could be one of several possibilities.  First, and
   most commonly, is that people simply forget to specify /etc/shadow as the
   password file when using shadowed passwords.  This generally happens on
   manual installs only, as setup.pl does some checking to make sure that
   there are encrypted passwords in whatever file it defaults to.

   The next possibility is that while the program knows where your passwords
   are stored, it cannot open the file to read them, because it has
   insufficient permissions.  Checklogin.pl should generally run suid root,
   unless you choose a manual install and used a file that doesn't require root
   permissions to be read for your encrypted passwords.

   If this isn't the case, another likely possibility is that while you have
   the Perl interpreter on your system, you don't have the additional wrapper
   program included in most Perl distributions, suidperl.  This should
   generally exist in the same directory as perl does, and be setuid root.
   When perl opens a setuid script, it sees the setuid bit, and since most
   operating systems don't allow scripts to run setuid, it calls the suidperl
   executable to run the scrpit with root permissions.

Q. Does NeoMail support MD5 passwords?

A. The short answer is YES.  The (slightly) longer answer is that since NeoMail
   uses the Perl crypt() function, passing it the entire encrypted password as a
   salt, crypt() is able to detect the telltale $1$ at the beginning of the
   password and know that it is encrypted using MD5, then use the proper
   encryption algorithm to perform the password check.
