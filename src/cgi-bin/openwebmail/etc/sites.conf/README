This directory is used to put virtualdomain specific configuration file.

For example, you have 3 virtual domains on the same server:

  vr1.domain.com
  vr2.domain.com
  vr3.domain.com

You may create 3 files with the above names in this directory by copying 
openwebmail.conf to this direcotry and have different settings for each
virtualdomain. 

Openwebmail will read openwebmail.conf first, then use the following 
information to find which virtualdomain configuration file to load:

1. the domainname in the URL
2. the domainname in the loginame 

Settings in virtualdomain specific configuration will override the same one
in openwebmail.conf and openwebmail.conf.default
