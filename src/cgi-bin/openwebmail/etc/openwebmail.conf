# will be ignored if you're using a system that doesn't store mail spools
# in a common directory, and you set homedirspools to 'yes'
#
mailspooldir		/var/mail

#
# use_hashedmailspools : Set this to 'yes' if your mail spool directory is
# set up like /var/spool/mail/u/s/username. Most default sendmail installs
# aren't set up this way, you'll know if you need it.
#
use_hashedmailspools	no

# use_homedirfolders   : Set this to 'yes' to put settings and folders for a

# homedirfolderdirname : Set this to 'mail' to use ~user/mail/ for user's
# homdirfolders, it is compatible with 'PINE' MUA.
#
use_homedirfolders	yes
homedirfolderdirname	mail

#
# use_dotlockfile : Set this to 'yes' to use .lock file for filelock

# an remote nfs server and the lockd on your nfs server or client has problems
# ps: the freebsd/linux nfs may need this. solaris doesn't.

#
deliver_use_GMT		no

#
# savedsuid_support: Does your system support 'saved set-user-ID' ?
# On system with saved set-user-ID support, the effective uid of a process 
# will be saved to 'saved set-user-ID' (structure prepared by OS) before euid 
# is changed, thus the process can switch back to previous euid if required.
#
# If this option is set to 'no', openwebmail will tries to save euid 0 to ruid,
# this give the same effect as 'saved set-user-ID' but is somewhat unsafe 
# since child forked by openwebmail may have ruid 0
#
# Only set this to 'no' if you got 'authentication error' in changing passwd.
# eg: perl 5.6.1 on FreeBSD 4.4 is found to need setting this to 'no'.
#
savedsuid_support	yes
