#               be immediately deleted, until space is freed.  This does not
#               prevent the operation taking the user over this limit from

#             attachment size only, and will not prevent users from receiving 
#             messages with large attachments.  That's up to you in your 
#             sendmail configuration. Set this to 0 to disable the limit 
#             (not recommended).
