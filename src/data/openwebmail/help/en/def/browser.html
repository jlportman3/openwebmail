<p>
A software application used to locate and display Web pages. The two most
popular browsers are Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer. Both of
these are graphical browsers, which means that they can display graphics as well
as text. In addition, most modern browsers can present multimedia information,
including sound and video, though they require plug-ins for some formats.
