<h3> INTRODUCTION</h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Open WebMail is a webmail system based on the <a href="http://neomail.sourceforge.net/">Neomail</a> 
    version 1.14 from <a href="mailto:neorants@users.sourceforge.net">Ernie Miller</a>. 
    Open WebMail is targeted on dealing with very big mail folder files in a memory 
    efficient way. It also provides many features to help users to switch from 
    Microsoft Outlook smoothly. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><b>FEATURES</b></h3>

<blockquote> 
  <h4>Fast Folder Access</h4>
  The folder access is greatly improved by using dbm (dbm is a simple database 
  provided by perl). When a mail folder is selected in the folder view, Open WebMail 
  will parse the mail folder file and cache the parsed result to a dbm. This dbm 
  is reused whenever the user wants to access the folder. This dbm cache eliminates 
  the scanning of whole folder file every time, which makes a big difference when 
  dealing with a large folder file. In case there are any change in the folder 
  file, the dbm will be automatically updated. The dbm update is incremental if 
  the folder modification is done by the Open WebMail itself. The dbm will only 
  be recreated when a folder is found to be changed by other programs. 

  <h4> Efficient Message Movement</h4>
  The size of a message will be slightly increased after it is read at the first 
  time because of status&nbsp; change. A large movement of messages may be introduced 
  due to the size change. Also, the user may want to move a bunch of messages 
  between two folders. The routines for message update and movement are totally 
  rewrite so that only necessary movement will be made in a very memory efficient 
  way. 

  <h4> Smaller Memory Footprint</h4>
  Many efforts have been put in optimizing the memory usage of Open WebMail. The 
  memory footprint of Open WebMail is much smaller than its ancestor when dealing 
  with messages containing large attachments (eg: a 20MB attachment). It runs 
  smoothly on a medium sized machine now. (eg: Celeron 300 with 128MB ram). 

  <h4>Convenient Folder/Message Operation</h4>
  <p>Open WebMail supports create, rename, delete, download operations on folders.
     And it supports 'move', 'copy', 'delete' and 'download' operations on messages.</p>

  <h4>Graceful File Lock</h4>
  <p>Since a mail folder may be used by multiple programs simultaneously, it is 
    necessary to do file lock before accessing the folder. Open WebMail uses a 
    blocking lock with timeout limit 30 seconds. It gives the lock a better chance 
    to success than a nonblocking lock which returns error immediately if it can 
    not get the lock. Open WebMail also supports locking by dotlock file which 
    ensure the file locking will work on platform with incomplete NFS lockd implementation.</p>

  <h4>Virtual Hosting and Login Alias</h4>
  <p>Open Webmail can use the <a href="http://www.sendmail.org/virtual-hosting.html">
     sendmail genericstable</a> to map a local user account 
     to virtualuser@virtualhost. The user can login the webmail system with the
     aliased name 'virtualuser' and all mails from this user will be sent with email 
     address 'virtualuser@virtualhost'
  </p>

  <h4>Full Content Search</h4>
  Full content search with regular expression support is provided. When user enters 
  a keyword in the search box, the scope of a mail folder will be limited to the 
  keyword related messages. This means the user can use the sort or static functions 
  on the search result. The scope limit will be released when the user selects 
  another folder or refreshes the current folder. 

  <h4> Better MIME Message Capability</h4>
  While most webmail packages have poor effect on displaying MIME messages, the 
  Open Webmail gives you very fancy effect for that. You can get almost the same 
  output for MIME messages as you would get on Microsoft Outlook. It does this 
  through supporting unlimited levels of attachments and cid object cross-reference 
  inside attachments. Open WebMail also supports uuencoded block inside messages, 
  it displays those uuencoded block as they were normal attachments. 

  <h4>Draft Folder Support</h4>
  This feature enables the user to write a message by several times even several 
  days. The user can save the unfinished messages into the draft folder and continue 
  the editing at any time. It would be very convenient when you are writing a 
  long mail. 

  <h4>Spelling Check Support</h4>
  The spelling check in Open WebMail is very friendly yet powerful, it makes suggestions 
  for those mis-spelled words. The user can correct the errors very easily by 
  selecting one of the suggestions from a drop-down menu. 

  <h4>POP3 Support</h4>
  Multiple POP3 accounts can be defined at the same time to fetch mails from various 
  mail servers. All pop3 messages will be stored at the INBOX folder. In case 
  the pop3 fetching takes more than 10 seconds (eg: slow link or large messages), 
  it will be put into background to avoid http timeout.

  <h4>Mail Filter Support</h4>
  <p>Multiple filter rules can be set to move/copy incoming mails into different 
    folders automatically or even delete them directly. The user can categorize 
    mails from specific person, mails from spammer or mails containing viruses 
    very easily by defining rules of sender, receiver, SMTP relay, subject, body 
    or filename of attachments. </p>
  <p>Since mail filtering is activated only in Open WebMail, which means messages 
    will stay in the INBOX until user reads their mail with Open WebMail. 'finger' 
    or other mail status check utility may give you wrong information because 
    they don't know about the filter. A command tool 'checkmail.pl' can be used 
    as finger replacement. It does mail filtering before report mail status. 

  <h4>Message Count Preview</h4>
  <p>When the user pulls down the folderlist menu to select a folder, the counts 
  of new messages and total messages of each mail folder will be displayed after 
  the folder name to help the user to find out those folders with unread messages.</p>

  <h4>Confirm Reading Support</h4>
  <p>The user can request a 'confirm-reading receipt' for the message he sent. 
    When the message is read by the receiver, a receipt will be sent back to this 
    user. </p>
  <p>There are too many small enhancements to mention about. You may need to find 
    them by yourself... </p>
