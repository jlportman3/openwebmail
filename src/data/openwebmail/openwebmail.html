<p>Open WebMail is a webmail system based on the <a href="http://neomail.sourceforge.net/">Neomail</a> 
  version 1.14 from <a href="mailto:neorants@users.sourceforge.net">Ernie Miller</a>. 
  While the original neomail has a good user interface and many neat features, 
  it suffers from slow response for big folder files and large memory usage. Open 
  WebMail is targeted on dealing with very big mail folder files 
  in a memory efficient way to make it the fastest webmail in the world. It also 
  provides many features to help users to switch from Microsoft Outlook smoothly. 
  Open WebMail has the following enhancements over Neomail 1.14:</p>

<h3>Folder access speedup with dbm</h3>
<blockquote>The folder access is greatly improved by using dbm (dbm is a simple 
  database provided by perl). When a mail folder is selected in the folder view, 
  Open WebMail will parse the mail folder file and cache the parsed result to a dbm. 
  This dbm is reused whenever the user wants to access the folder. This dbm cache 
  eliminates the scanning of whole folder file every time, which makes a big difference 
  when dealing with a large folder file. In case there are any change in the folder 
  file, the dbm will be automatically updated. The dbm update is incremental if 
  the folder modification is done by the Open WebMail itself. The dbm will only be 
  recreated when a folder is found to be changed by other programs.</blockquote>

<h3> Efficient movement of messages</h3>
<blockquote>The size of a message will be slightly increased after it is read 
  at the first time because of status&nbsp; change. A large movement of messages 
  may be introduced due to the size change. Also, the user may want to move a 
  bunch of messages between two folders. The routines for message update and movement 
  are totally rewrite so that only necessary movement will be made in a very memory 
  efficient way.</blockquote>

<h3> Smaller memory footprint</h3>
<blockquote>Many efforts have been put in optimizing the memory usage of Open WebMail.
The memory footprint of Open WebMail is much smaller than its ancestor when dealing 
with messages containing large attachments (ex: a 20MB attachment). It runs smoothly 
on a medium sized machine now. (ex: Celeron 300 with 128MB ram).
</blockquote>

<h3> Much graceful filelock</h3>
<blockquote>Since a mail folder may be used by mutiple programs simultaneously, 
  it is necessary to do file lock before accessing the folder. Open WebMail 
  uses a blocking lock with timeout limit 30 seconds. It gives the lock a better 
  chance to success than a nonblocking lock which returns error immediately if 
  it can not get the lock.</blockquote>

<h3> Full content search with regular expression support</h3>
<blockquote>Full content search with regular expression support is provided. When 
  user enters a keyword in the search box, the scope of a mail folder will be 
  limited to the keyword related messages. This means the user can use the sort 
  or static functions on the search result. The scope limit will be released when 
  the user selects another folder or refreshes the current folder.</blockquote>

<h3> Better support for MIME message display</h3>
<blockquote>While most webmail packages have poor effect on displaying MIME messages, 
  the Open Webmail gives you very fancy effect for that. You can get almost 
  the same output for MIME messages as you would get on Microsoft Outlook. It does 
  this through supporting unlimited levels of attachments and cid object crossreference 
  inside attachments.</blockquote>

<h3> POP3 support</h3>
<blockquote>Multiple POP3 accounts can be defined at the same time to fetch mails 
  from various mail servers. All pop3 messages will be stored at the INBOX folder. 
  In case the pop3 fetching takes more than 10 seconds (ex: slow link or large 
  messages), it will be put into background to avoid http timeout. </blockquote>

<h3> Draft folder support</h3>
<blockquote>This feature enables the user to wirte a message by several times 
even serveral days. The user can save the unfinished messages into the 
draft folder and continue the editing at any time. It would be very convinet 
when you are writing a long mail.</blockquote>

<h3> Mail filter support</h3>
<blockquote> 
  <p>Multiple filter rules can be set to redirect incoming mails into different 
    folders automatically. The user can categorize mails from specific person, 
    mails from spammer or mails containing viruses very easily by defining rules 
    of sender, receiver, smtp relay, subject, body or filename of attachments. </p>
  <p>Since mail filtering is activated only in Open WebMail, which means messages 
    will stay in the INBOX until user reads their mail with Open WebMail. 
    'finger' or other mail status check utility may give you wrong 
    information because they don't know about the filter.
    A command tool 'checkmail.pl' can be used as finger replacement.
    It does mail filtering before report mail status. 
</blockquote>

<h3><b>Message Count Preview</b></h3>
<blockquote> 
<p>When the user pulls down the folderlist menu to select a folder, the counts 
  of new messages and total messages of each mail folder will be displayed after 
  the folder name to help the user to find out those folders with unreaded messages.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3><b>Confirm Reading support</b></h3>
<blockquote> 
<p>The user can request a 'confirm-reading receipt' for the message he sent.
When the message is read by the receiver, a receipt will be sent back to
this user.
</blockquote>

There are too many small enhancements to mention about. 
You may need to find them by yourself...

<p><i>An earlier version of the dbm access and message movement was submitted to 
the Neomail 1.20. <br>
Since basically I have a different point of view for programming than Erine, I 
decide to release this version by myself.</i>
