   (thanks to Alex Teslik, alex.AT.acatysmoof.com for his great implementation)

ps: BETA! NOT PRODUCTION READY!

    The new addressbook code has NOT been tested worldwide.
    Although every effort has been made to eliminate any possible errors,
    it is STRONGLY recommended that this code should NOT be run in a
    production environment until it can be tested by a larger user base.

ps: It is okay to install the new version over the old one.
    but don't forget to remove import.gif, export.gif
    from data/images/iconsets/*/ (which are not used any more)

ps: If you are upgrading from older openwebmail, don't forget to convert
    the global addressbook to new vard format by

	openwebmail-tool.pl -c

    The user addressbook will be auto converted at the first access.
    However, the sysadm may also choose to convert the addressbook for all
    users manually by

	openwebmail-tool.pl -c -a
