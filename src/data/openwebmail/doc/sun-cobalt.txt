Subject: Virtual Domains on RAQ -How to set up

There have been a few posts recently about handling multiple domains on RAQ 
and getting default emails to lose the http://www. Here is how to do it.

Use latest current relase of OWM (now available as a pkg)

in openwebmail.conf set allowed domains as follows:
allowed_serverdomain mydomain.com, yourdomain.com 
(put here a list of each virtual domain that you allow to use OWM 
 remembering to prefix with www)

for each domain create a copy of openwebmail.conf in 
'/home/openwebmail/cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/sites.conf' 
with the file name set the same as your virtual domain 
(example mydomain.com prefixed with www)

in each of these files, add or edit line:
domainnames mydomain.com 
(do not use www)

Set up in this way, only allowed_serverdomains can use webmail and default 
users mail on first use will become user@mydomain.com

I have this setup and it works correctly

There is no need to do any editing of the virtual user table and I would 
advise against this unless you are careful becasue it can screw up other 
parts of sendmail.

Hope this helps.

I set up like this by reading Tung's posts the commented guides in the .conf 
files and Taco's advice and GREAT effort in getting up a new pkg. I had never 
ever touched linux until 2 weeks ago.
