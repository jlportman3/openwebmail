How to define a servicename 'openwebmail' in your PAM system
--------------------------------------------------------------

There are definitons for different servicenames to tell the PAM system
what authentication methods should be used for a servicename when an
request comes.

All we have to do is to make definition for openwebmail
and put it into the PAM configuration file(/etc/pam.conf)
                 or PAM configuration directory (/etc/pam.d/),
thus Open WebMail can use the servicename 'openwebmail to send request
to PAM system for user authentication later.

ps: Since openwebmail 20040722, the auth_pam.pl uses the servicename 'login'
    to send request to PAM system, so there is no need to as the openwebmail
    service name any more, unless you want to authenticate your user with
    some specific method through PAM.

a. On system with file /etc/pam.conf (eg: FreeBSD 4.x, Solaris 5.8):

   All PAM services are defined in same file: /etc/pam.conf,
   All we have to do is to copy the entries from other servicenames
   and change it into openwebmail.
   (We suggest you copy from the servicename definition of pop3, passwd or login)

Be aware that the newly added lines should not be put at the end of file,
it should be appended at least before the line of servicename 'other'.

b. On system with directory /etc/pam.d (eg: FreeBSD 5.x, most Linux):
   Each PAM service is defined in one file under /etc/pam.d/
   with the servicename as filename
   all we have to do is to copy the file of other servicenames
   and rename it as openwebmail.
   (We suggest you copy the servicename definition file of pop3, passwd or login)

c. Below are some examples...

(on Solaris with /etc/pam.conf)
openwebmail   auth	required	/usr/lib/security/pam_unix.so.1
openwebmail   account	required	/usr/lib/security/pam_unix.so.1
openwebmail   password	required	/usr/lib/security/pam_unix.so.1

(on Linux with /etc/pam.conf)
openwebmail   auth	required	/lib/security/pam_unix.so
openwebmail   account	required	/lib/security/pam_unix.so
openwebmail   password	required	/lib/security/pam_unix.so

(on FreeBSD with /etc/pam.conf)
openwebmail   auth	required	/usr/lib/pam_unix.so
openwebmail   account	required	/usr/lib/pam_unix.so
openwebmail   password	required	/usr/lib/pam_unix.so

(on Linux with /etc/pam.d/,
 by protech.AT.protech.net.tw)
auth       required	/lib/security/pam_unix.so
account    required	/lib/security/pam_unix.so
password   required	/lib/security/pam_unix.so

(on Linux with /etc/pam.d/, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 3, Fedora Core 1 or Red Hat Linux 9
 by Milan Kerslager, milan.kerslager.AT.pslib.cz)
auth       required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
account    required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
session    required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth
password   required     pam_stack.so service=system-auth

ps: PAM support on some release of FreeBSD seems broken (eg:4.1)
