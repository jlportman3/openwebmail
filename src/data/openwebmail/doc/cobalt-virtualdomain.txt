There have been a few posts recently about handling multiple domains on RAQ
and getting default emails to lose the http://www. Here is how to do it.

Use latest current relase of OWM (now available as a pkg)

in openwebmail.conf set allowed domains as follows:
allowed_serverdomain mydomain.com, yourdomain.com
(put here a list of each virtual domain that you allow to use OWM
 remembering to prefix with www)

for each domain create a copy of openwebmail.conf in
'/home/openwebmail/cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/sites.conf'
with the file name set the same as your virtual domain
(example mydomain.com prefixed with www)

in each of these files, add or edit line:
domainnames mydomain.com
(do not use www)

Set up in this way, only allowed_serverdomains can use webmail and default
users mail on first use will become user@mydomain.com

I have this setup and it works correctly

There is no need to do any editing of the virtual user table and I would
advise against this unless you are careful becasue it can screw up other
parts of sendmail.

Hope this helps.

I set up like this by reading Tung's posts the commented guides in the .conf
files and Taco's advice and GREAT effort in getting up a new pkg. I had never
ever touched linux until 2 weeks ago.

After many hours of research =). Here's the real Step By Step of
how to make OpenWebMail work on Cobalt Raq Server
(I used it on RaQ3, RaQ4 and other RaQs), and fix the http://www. on the users emails:

1.- Download and Install from pkgmaster.com, the latest version of OWM
    (Must be 1.71 or better) I do not recomend the use older versions of OWM.
2.- Access the server shell and su to become root.
3.- Execute the follow commands:

[root]# cd /home/openwebmail/cgi-bin/openwebmail/etc/
[root]# cp openwebmail.conf openwebmail.bak
[root]# pico openwebmail.conf

(Type or make sure this file have this two lines)

domainnames auto
domainnames_override yes

5.- Copy the backup openwebmail.bak file to sites.conf directory:

[root]# cp openwebmail.bak sites.conf/www.yoursite.com

6.- Edit the new virtual site webmail configuration file:

[root]# pico sites.conf/www.yoursite.com

(Type or make sure this file have this line and type the domain with
 out the www)

domainnames yoursite.com

Once you had made this the first time, you just have to do the 5 & 6
steps for each site on your RaQ, or make a perl script (as the one I use)
to automate this process, reading the server Virtual Site List,
from directory /usr/admserv/html/.cobalt/siteManage.
